    ✔ Distinguish between opening and closing tokens @done(21-01-28 14:30)

IMAGE GENERATOR:
    ☐ Determine image dimensions
    ✘ Determine char spacing @cancelled(21-01-28 17:13)
        ✔ Make my own text-drawer function, with my own spacing. @done(21-01-29 14:20)

FORMATTER:
    ✔ Fix indentation level @done(21-01-28 18:44)
    ☐ Maybe rename to 'indenter'?
    ☐ Return minimum required space (in chars)

RE-WRITE:
    ☐ Rewrite Tokenizer and Formatter in Rust.
        They will then be WASM'd and then I'll display this thing dynamically (with some js magic)
        It is also important to note that I know basically 0 js :)
        ✔ Deserialize json. @done(21-01-30 20:57)
            How do I want to deal with this?
            My idea is to have the main js script pass on a string and then have rust deserialize it.
            To deal with that, I'll have to add the json file and serve it with github pages. @high
