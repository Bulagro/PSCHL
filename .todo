    ☐ Rewrite Tokenizer and Formatter in Rust.
        They will then be WASM'd and then I'll display this thing dynamically (with some js magic)
        It is also important to note that I know basically 0 js :)
        ✔ Deserialize json. @done(21-01-30 20:57)
            How do I want to deal with this?
            My idea is to have the main js script pass on a string and then have rust deserialize it.
            To deal with that, I'll have to add the json file and serve it with github pages. @high

        ✔ Allow the tokenizer to find lowercase, uppercase and mixed-case keywords. @done(21-02-01 02:06)

                    Parsing data this way is complicated, since there isn't a specific syntax for input, output and name.
